<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tacos are super easy to make and worth it!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tortilla</li>
<li>Steak/Chicken/Beef</li>
<li>Salsa</li>
<li>Lettuce</li>
<li>Cheese<lil>
<li>Tomato<lil>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>The first step to building the ultimlie taco is selecting the shell. Soft or hard.</li>
<li>Chicken, pork, beef, or shrimp. Whatever protein you choose, a taco surely wouldnâ€™t be the same without the meat.</li>
<li> Adding the cheese can be crucial to a good taco. In order to create the ultimate taco, consider putting cheese on the bottom of the shell to prevent the shell from getting soggy and topping your protein with cheese.</li>
<li> Do you like sour cream? How about guacamole? Beans? Whatever your favorite taco toppings are, this is the time to throw them on. Top off your taco with your favorite toppings to make it all yours.</li>
<li>Add the salsas and veggies last. Pico de gallo and diced tomatoes can make the taco shell soggy, and putting the lettuce on top prevents it from getting warm.</li>
</ol>
